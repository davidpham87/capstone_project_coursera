\initial{E}\textbf{nergy as a good is a paradox: inexpensive but scarce and
  indispensable at the same time.} There exist a tremendous challenge for the
institutions to inform the customers on the energy consumption of their buying
in order to reduce the environmental impact. In that respect, NGOs usually
display disastrous manifestations of our over-consumption of energy and
governmental institutions often try to inform buyers of the costs of their
purchases on their overall lifetime. For that reasons, several \emph{ranks} or
\emph{classes} of energy efficiency have been applied to distinguish the products. For
example, in Europe the label of a home appliance is ranked by a letter from G
(worse) to A+++ (best). In a perfect world, these labels should rank two
comparable goods according to their overall costs. This is however not the
case. This report conducts an empirical research on the complete Swiss market of
home appliances and shows that buying the most efficient product is
unfortunately \emph{not often} the cheapest decision when considering the cost during the lifetime of a product.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In a research sponsored by the Swiss Federal Office of the energy to study
consumer behavior concerning investment choices on energy using product (EuP),
the following question raised our interest: considering the total lifetime cost of EuP, how much money and energy are saved by purchasing the most efficient good within a category of comparable products
? In order to answer this question,
information has been gathered on the following home appliances:

\begin{itemize}
\item oven, 
\item clothes dryers, 
\item clothes washers, 
\item dishwashers, 
\item freezers and 
\item fridges.
\end{itemize}

These products have been selected because in each category of device, they are
homogeneous and there exist legal requirements for their minimum energy
efficiency. Additionally, personal preference of the consumer should play a
small role in the selection of a product. Several
data-cleaning\footnote{Techniques such as data extraction, formatting and
  comparison from \textsf{XML} and \textsf{html} files with regular
  expressions.} and statistical algorithms have been performed in order to
detect nonrandom signals. We tried to answer to the following questions:
considering the price offered by Swiss online retailers, does it pay off over
its lifetime to buy the most efficient, namely the A+++, product?  If yes, by
how much? Are their relevant predictors that could help the consumers in their choices? Finally, is the ratio between the price offered by retailers and the catalog price of the producers differs
across different energy ranks?

In the remaining of the introduction, a summary of Swiss regulation is
given. Then Section \ref{sec:data} describes the data, how they were collected
and some exploratory plots.  Section \ref{sec:methodology} provides an overview
of the statistical methods applied to the data and Section \ref{sec:results}
analyzes the results. Section \ref{sec:discussion} concludes the report with a
short discussion.

\subsection{Swiss Regulations}
\label{sec:regulations}
Switzerland uses the same grading scheme and labels as the European Union for
EuP, but with tighter minimum requirement in term of efficiency. For each
product category, a good is ranked according to a score called the \emph{energy
  efficiency index}. This number is computed with respect to complex
standardized rules created by the European Union \cite{EU2009}.

In Table \ref{tab:min.requ.EuP}, regulations and minimum requirements on EuP are
summarized. More details can be found in \cite{BFE2013},

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    Product category & Switzerland & EU\\ 
    \hline \vspace{-9.5pt}\\ 
    Oven & B & None \\
    Clothes Dryers & A & None \\
    Clothes Washers & A & A \\
    Dishwashers & A & A \\
    Freezers, Fridges & A++ & A \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Minimum energy rank requirement for EuP in CH and EU in 2013.}
  \label{tab:min.requ.EuP}
\end{table}

One interesting remark is that for Swiss oven and clothes dryers, there are currently
\emph{no appliances with a better rank than A}.

\section{Data}
\label{sec:data}
This section includes a description of the data, several definitions used for the analysis and some graphical summaries.

\subsection{Data collection}
\label{sec:data-collection}

The online database of the Energie Agentur Elektroger\"{a}te (EAE)
\cite{EAE2013} has been used to perform the analysis.  On this site, relevant
specifications of home appliances are maintained and given to the consumers. All
these data were carefully recorded.

Then for each of the 1758 products in the EAE database, its minimum price, its
availability and a list of Swiss online retailers providing the product have
been recorded from two online price comparators (guenstiger.ch \cite{GU2013} and
toppreise.ch \cite{TP2013}).

Annual costs of energy are only provided for some categories of products in the
EAE databases. When the only available information was the energy consumption
per use, the average usage per year was taken from \textsf{topten.ch} \cite{TT2012}. This
internet site is an entity financed by the WWF, EWZ and Romandie
Energie\footnote{For details, consult wwf.ch, ewz.ch and romande-energie.ch‎}
which goals is to informs potential consumers on their energy consumption. Once
the average use per year is set, the annual energy consumption is trivially
computed as the product of the energy consumption per use and the average number
of use per year.

One regrettable feature of the problem with home appliances is that many
producers offer only one product in each possible category products. It means
there is often only one observation for a given brand, size, energy class and
product category. It follows that regression analysis might encounter some
singularities and the results might have a high variance.

\subsection{Data structure}
\label{sec:data-structure}
For each product were recorded the name of its producer and of the model, the
energy rank, the category (the type of home appliance), energy consumption (per
use or annual), a list of retailers offering the product and the price they
offer for it and the volume if applicable. The energy ranks ranged from B to
A+++.

The \emph{purchasing price} $p$ is defined as the minimum purchasing price in
[CHF] found by online Swiss retailers. For each product, its affiliated
\emph{running cost} $c_r$ is defined as
\begin{align} \label{eq:run.cost}
  c_r = c_y q \sum_{j=1}^{L} (\alpha\delta)^j,
\end{align}
where 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $c_y$, is an approximation of the yearly energy consumption in [kWh/year];
\item $q$, the price of one unit of [kWh] in [CHF/kWh];
\item $\alpha$, the annual expected increase of the energy price;
\item $\delta$, the discounting coefficient;
\item $L$, the expected lifetime of a appliance in [years].
\end{enumerate}

Otherwise stated, all these parameters except for $c_y$ have been set to a
constant value. These reflect, in our opinion, the numbers a typical consumer
would use to calculate the running costs. These values are found in Table
\ref{tab:def.val.par}. Analysis have been performed to assess the sensitivity of
the running costs in Subsection \ref{sec:sensitivity-analysis}.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{llll}
    $q$ [CHF/kWh]& $\alpha$ & $\delta$ & $L$ [year] \vspace{1pt}\\
    \hline \vspace{-9.5pt} \\
    $0.2$ & $1.00$ & $1.00$ & $15$
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Parameters' default value for the running cost $c_r$.}
  \label{tab:def.val.par}
\end{table}

Additionally the \emph{total costs} $c_t$ is logically defined as the sum of the
purchasing price $p$ and the running cost $c_r$.

The purchasing price $p$ is put in contrast to the catalog price $p_c$, that is
the price displayed in the catalog (or the recommended selling price) of the
producers. The catalog price $p_c$ can be extracted from the EAE database. The
\emph{discount} or \emph{relative rebate} are then defined as $1 - p/p_c$ and are used to determine if there
exists a discrimination with respect to the energy class applied by the
retailers, that is if they discount their product differently according to the
energy rank of the products.

Moreover, since for each product a list of possible retailers was available, a
score for the \emph{competitiveness} of the retailers has been defined. For each
product, the score of a retailer is computed as the ratio between the price at
which the retailers offers the product and the minimum of the prices proposed by
all the retailers. 

Furthermore, in order to get to isolate the effect the effect of the energy
class on the purchasing price and the total cost, the notion of \emph{twin
  products} has been introduced. Two or more products are considered as twin if
the only notable feature differentiating them is the energy consumption (and
hence the energy class). Brand, volume or size and energy class have been used
to classify if devices had a twin or not.

Further, within a family $\mathcal{T}$ of twin products $x$ (i.e. a set products
similar to each other with respect to almost all aspects but the energy class),
select a quantitative feature $f$ of the product, such as the purchasing price,
the total cost or the discount. Then for each product of element $x$ of
$\mathcal{T}$, the \emph{difference with the minimum} of the selected feature is
defined to
\begin{align*}
  f(x) -  \min_{u \in \mathcal{T}} \{f(u)\}.
\end{align*}
This measure is useful to compare the observations across the different sets of
twin products. Note that this kind of measure can only be applied for twin products.

The price of a [kWh] is one of the parameter that a government could manipulate in order to conduct its energy policy. Within a family of twin products, one could compute a threshold for the energy price above which the most efficient product would have the lowest total cost.  This threshold is defined as \emph{minimum energy price before profit} and can be found in Table \ref{tab:price-min-energy} for each device category and brands.

% For example, two products could have the same features (energy rank, volume, 
% brand, product category) but would differentiate in their construction
% material. In this case, the cheapest of both product was chosen.

% \subsection{Possible bias and sources of flaws}
% \label{sec:possible-bias-flaws}

%  A product's energy consumption is the most sensitive parameter of the
%  analysis. That is why the main database of our analysis is taken from an
%  official institution. 

% Issues might arise because EAE database might not be up to
% date and do not always reflect the state of the market.

% Concerning the energy consumption comparison between twin products, there are
% three potential sources of bias. The first one is the impossibility to include
% old appliances appearing in the EAE database but not referenced in the online
% retailers because retailers do not offer them anymore. The second bias is that
% new models are absent of the EAE database and information on energy consumption
% had to be manually provided by researching on the producers description for
% products with energy class A++ or better. The third one is the error of
% classifying mistakenly two products as twin products. For example, it might
% happen that two products are classified as twins, because of their seeming
% similarities (brand, volume, size, name), but in reality there is some
% characteristic that we could not detect which would differentiate them a lot
% (the construction material for example).

% Further, the selection of the minimum price as the purchasing price as well as
% the basis for the computation for the discount is a subject of discussion. Do
% consumers search for the best offer or do they take the first acceptable offer?
% This is an open question, but the choice of the minimum price yield a more
% conservative conclusion and diminishes the possibility of false positive
% decisions.

% Moreover, it would have been practically impossible to collect all the data
% manually. Several programs needed to be build for collecting data
% automatically. As one can never guarantee the absence of potential programming
% errors, this might be a source of mistake. However, these programs have been
% tested during months and had reliable results. Finally, humans mistakes always
% have non-zero probability to happen, even though they should be observable in
% exploratory plots.


\subsection{Exploratory analysis}
\label{sec:exploratory-analysis}

Descriptions of the figures to support the exploratory analysis are provided in Table \ref{tab:explor-plot} and these figures are at the end of the report.


\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

In order to get significant measures on the effect of the energy rank on the
total cost and on the discount, a standard weighted multiple linear regression
on categorical data with a \v Sid\'ak correction on the $p$-values had been
performed. Both methods are briefly presented in Section
\ref{sec:meth-deta}.


As there are not enough data, four models will be fitted. Observations from
Figure \ref{fig:twin.sum.plot} were studied under two different models. The
first model describes the dependent variable as a linear combination of the
brand and the energy class, whereas the second model assume a linear combination
between the device category and the energy class. The range of the variable can
be found in Table \ref{tab:variable.reg}.



\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}


Outputs of the regressions are found in Table \ref{tab:reg.out}. Without even
considering \v Sid\'ak correction for the $p$-value, all predictive variables
seem to be non-significant. There is however one case where the energy class
seems to play a role: A++ devices seems to have a higher discount estimated at
1\%.

These analyses tell two things: among twin products, that is products who are
almost identical but for their energy consumption, one can not reject (in the
statistical sense) the two hypothesis: Across all products,

\begin{enumerate}
\item total costs are identical;
\item discounts are identical.
\end{enumerate}

It implies that the difference in purchasing price might be compensated by
the energy consumption.

% Additionally to remarks in Section \ref{sec:possible-bias-flaws},
Notice that because of a lack of data points, estimates from
the four analysis in Section \ref{sec:results} unfortunately suffer from great
correlation between each other.



\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}
\label{sec:sensitivity-analysis}

The analysis is highly sensitive to the parameters used to compute the running
cost $c_r$. Even though derivatives (or finite differences) of Equation
(\ref{eq:run.cost}) are easily computed, it is a good practice to graphically
represent the sensitivity. In Figure \ref{fig:sensitivity.analysis}, the running
cost of a standard fridge with a volume of 315 litter are simulated under
different conditions. Under the most realistic conditions\footnote{$L = 15$,
  $\alpha \approx 1$, $\delta \approx 1$ in Equation (\ref{eq:run.cost}).}, the
previous results are fairly stable.

Additionally, the analysis is conservative, in the sense that all the parameters
$\alpha, L, \delta$ have greater impact than for most other devices. This means
that observations are magnified compared to other appliances. Indeed, a 315
litter fridge is bigger than most sold fridge and fridges consume more energy
than most other EuP. Hence, if no effects are detected in this setup, it is
quite unlikely that they appear in most other cases.

It results from this analysis that our results are reasonably robust.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

Empirically, some brands provide goods for which the savings in energy costs
compensate the higher purchasing price. However, this statement is by far not
shared by the great majority of our observations, even though our statistical
analysis can not detect any difference between twin products.

Furthermore, the amount of savings in running costs is very small compared to initial investment
and also with respect to the lifetime of the appliance. In most cases, 250 [CHF]
could be saved over 15 years by buying the most efficient EuP with the
\emph{best online offer}. Are the savings worth the cost of research for the minimum price of a household appliance, in a
country where the median salary is at 6500 [CHF]?

Moreover, it remains an open question if the criteria to define labels should be
based on energy efficiency over energy consumption. Indeed, from the points of
view of energy producers (which often are states) what matters is the absolute
value of consumed energy from a product and not its efficiency. As displayed in
Figure \ref{fig:energy.consumption} there exist products which consume less
energy that other products with a better energy rank (due to the fact the later
products are bigger in size then the former). However, where should the effort
go? Motivating consumers to buy more efficient products or buying the products
which consume the least energy? This question has even more weight in other
markets than home appliances, such as in the automobile or consumer electronic
devices markets.

Finally, it was unfortunately demonstrated that buying the most efficient EuP is
almost always not the best economic decision. Moreover, when there was a saving of running costs,
it was at best negligible. It follows that consumers are economically rational
economic behavior when they are not buying the most efficient EuP.. Under these conditions, displaying additional
information on the running cost will probably not change their buying pattern.

\section{Methodological details}
\label{sec:meth-deta}
This section provide an overview of the statistical machinery used to obtain the
results.

\subsection{Weighted linear regression}
For $i=1, \dots, n$, the variable $y_i$ denotes the response and $\bm{x}_i =
(x_{i1}, \dots, x_{ip})^\top$ the predictors of observation $i$. Then the linear
regression predicts the value of the response $y_i$ as
\begin{align*}
  y_i = f(\bm{x}_i, \bm{\beta}) + \varepsilon_i,
\end{align*}
where
\begin{align*}
f(\bm{x}_i, \bm{\beta}) =  \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_{i1} + \dots + \beta_p x_{ip},
\end{align*}
and where $\varepsilon_i$ are independent and identically distributed from a
centered distribution with finite variance.

Note that this assume that all errors have a common variance. The parameter
vector $\bm{\beta}$ is chosen such that it minimizes the risk
\begin{align*}
  \sum_{i=1}^n w_i r_i^2   
\end{align*}
where $r_i$ are the so-called residuals
\begin{align*}
 r_i =  y_i -  f(\bm{x}_i, \bm{\beta}),
\end{align*}
and where $w_i$ are the so-called weights. The weights are sets to be
identically equal to 1 for the ordinary linear regression. However, when the
errors $\varepsilon_i$ obviously do not possess a homogeneous variance, the
weights might be sets to $1/\hat\sigma_x^2$, the inverse of the fitted local
variance. In other words, in order to standardize the variance, the weights
$w_i$ are set to
\begin{align*}
  w_i = \exp\{- g(\bm{x}_i)\}
\end{align*}
where $g$ is some regression function predicting $\log r_i^2$ from $\bm{x}_i$. In this report, we set $g$ as a linear regression, that is $g(\bm{x}) = \bm{x}^\top\bm{\gamma}$ where $\bm{\gamma} \in \mathbb{R}^p$ minimize the mean quadratic difference of $\log r_i^2$ and $\bm{x_i}^\top \bm{\gamma}$.


\subsection{\v Sid\' ak correction} 
In a hypothesis test, one consider the $p$-value, as the measure to decide
whether to accept or to reject some null hypothesis $H_0$. In the case of
regression, the $H_0$ is the hypothesis that the regression vector $\bm{\beta}$
identically equals $\bm{0}$. The issue is that several hypothesis tests are
applied and the probability to obtain false results increases. \emph{\v Sid\' ak
  correction} (sometimes mistakenly referred as \emph{Bonferroni correction}) is
a method that corrects the problem by setting a stricter rejection
level. Namely, a coefficient $\beta_j$, $j = 1,\dots, p$, will be accepted at
the $1-\alpha$ confidence level if its estimated $p$-value respects
\begin{align*}
p\textrm{-value} \leq 1 - (1-\alpha)^{1/p},
\end{align*}
where $p$ in the right hand side of the formula is the number of predictors of $y_i$.
